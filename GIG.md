# Gig Marketplace Complete Flow Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the complete flow of the Gig Marketplace smart contract, from gig creation to order completion and payment release. The marketplace allows service providers to list their services and clients to order and pay for them.

## Smart Contract Architecture

The `GigMarketplace` contract includes two main entities:

### Gig Structure
```solidity
struct Gig {
    uint256 id;
    address payable provider;
    string title;
    string description;
    uint256 price;
    bool isActive;
    bool isCompleted;
    address token;
}
```

### Order Structure
```solidity
struct Order {
    uint256 id;
    uint256 gigId;
    address payable client;
    address payable provider;
    uint256 amount;
    bool isCompleted;
    bool isPaid;
    uint256 createdAt;
}
```

## Complete Gig Flow

### Step 1: Provider Creates a Gig
**Function:** `createGig(string title, string description, uint256 price, address token)`

**Process:**
1. Provider calls `createGig()` with gig details
2. Contract validates title is not empty and price > 0
3. Gig is stored with unique ID and marked as active
4. Provider's address is added to gig record
5. `GigCreated` event is emitted

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Successful gig creation
- ✅ Validation of empty titles
- ✅ Validation of zero prices
- ✅ Event emission verification

### Step 2: Client Orders the Gig
**Function:** `orderGig(uint256 gigId) payable`

**Process:**
1. Client finds an active gig they want to order
2. Client calls `orderGig()` with exact payment amount
3. Contract validates:
   - Gig is active
   - Payment amount matches gig price
   - Client is not the provider
4. Order is created with escrow payment held in contract
5. `OrderCreated` event is emitted

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Successful order creation
- ✅ Incorrect payment amount rejection
- ✅ Provider cannot order own gig
- ✅ Cannot order inactive gigs
- ✅ Payment held in escrow

### Step 3: Provider Completes the Work
**Function:** `completeOrder(uint256 orderId)`

**Process:**
1. Provider delivers the work/service to client
2. Provider calls `completeOrder()` to mark work as done
3. Contract validates only the provider can mark completion
4. Order status is updated to completed
5. `OrderCompleted` event is emitted
6. Payment remains in escrow until client releases it

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Provider can complete order
- ✅ Only provider can complete their orders
- ✅ Cannot complete already completed orders
- ✅ Event emission verification

### Step 4: Client Releases Payment
**Function:** `releasePayment(uint256 orderId)`

**Process:**
1. Client verifies work is satisfactory
2. Client calls `releasePayment()` to release escrowed funds
3. Contract validates:
   - Order is completed
   - Payment hasn't been released already
   - Only client can release payment
4. Platform fee (5%) is calculated and sent to contract owner
5. Remaining amount (95%) is sent to provider
6. `PaymentReleased` event is emitted

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Payment release after completion
- ✅ Cannot release before completion
- ✅ Cannot double-pay
- ✅ Only client can release payment
- ✅ Correct fee distribution (5% platform, 95% provider)

## Key Features

### Security Features
- **ReentrancyGuard:** Prevents reentrancy attacks on payment functions
- **Pausable:** Owner can pause contract in emergencies
- **Access Control:** Function-level permissions for providers and clients
- **Escrow System:** Payments held safely until work completion

### Platform Economics
- **Platform Fee:** 5% fee on all completed transactions
- **Fee Limit:** Platform fee cannot exceed 10%
- **Direct Payments:** ETH payments with immediate settlement

### Administrative Functions
- `setPlatformFee()`: Owner can adjust platform fee (max 10%)
- `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Owner can withdraw accumulated fees
- `pause()/unpause()`: Emergency contract controls

## Testing Strategy

The test suite covers:

### 1. Complete Flow Integration Test
Tests the entire journey from gig creation to payment release in a single test case.

### 2. Individual Function Tests
- **Order Tests:** Payment validation, access control, gig status checks
- **Payment Tests:** Escrow mechanics, completion requirements, double-payment prevention
- **Completion Tests:** Provider permissions, status updates

### 3. Edge Cases
- Multiple orders for same gig
- Contract balance management
- Non-existent order operations
- Multiple concurrent transactions

### 4. Security Tests
- Access control enforcement
- Payment amount validation
- State transition validation
- Reentrancy protection

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with gas reporting
npx hardhat test --network hardhat
```

## Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Hedera testnet
npm run deploy:testnet

# Deploy to Hedera mainnet
npm run deploy:mainnet

# Upgrade contract (if needed)
npm run upgrade:testnet
npm run upgrade:mainnet
```

## Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error messages:
- `"Title cannot be empty"`
- `"Price must be greater than 0"`
- `"Gig is not active"`
- `"Incorrect payment amount"`
- `"Cannot order your own gig"`
- `"Only gig provider can call this function"`
- `"Only order client can call this function"`
- `"Order is not completed"`
- `"Payment already released"`
- `"Order is already completed"`

## Events for Frontend Integration

All major actions emit events for easy frontend integration:
- `GigCreated(uint256 indexed gigId, address indexed provider, string title, uint256 price)`
- `OrderCreated(uint256 indexed orderId, uint256 indexed gigId, address indexed client, uint256 amount)`
- `OrderCompleted(uint256 indexed orderId)`
- `PaymentReleased(uint256 indexed orderId, address indexed provider, uint256 amount)`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Token Support:** Full ERC-20 token payment integration
2. **Dispute Resolution:** Arbitration system for disputed orders
3. **Rating System:** Provider and client ratings
4. **Deadline Management:** Order delivery deadlines
5. **Partial Payments:** Milestone-based payment releases
6. **Subscription Gigs:** Recurring service orders
